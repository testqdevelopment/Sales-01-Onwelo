The csv files are sent by the client to the email address you have access to. The files are to be downloaded automatically because they have a fixed name. The files are to be saved on the Azure platform.

1. What tools will you use to download the files, where will you save them?

Ans : If clients give me the access of git then i wll download file via mail directy/git thean that file save on my Aws s3 bucket or on my desktop path.

Example:-Use a combination of Python scripts and the IMAP/POP3 email protocol to download the CSV files from the email.

2. What will be the connection between the tools you choose?

Ans :- If i stored that file on s3 i will give direct path using my pyspark script/spark or using python script.
Example:- Python script connects to the email server using the IMAP/POP3 protocol.
The script then downloads the files and uses the Azure SDK for Python (Azure Storage Blob client library) to upload the files to Azure Blob Storage.

After saving, the files are to be cleaned of rows that are empty, 

Ans:-NoSQL Database/sql database  Use Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse) in serverless mode to store the cleaned data
Example:- Cleaning Tool: Use Azure Data Factory or Azure Databricks to clean the CSV files.

and after cleaning, the file is to be saved in such a way that they are available in the SQL serverless database. 
   You should connect PowerBi to this server and publish the report online.
Ans:-Power BI: Connect Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics using the built-in connector for Azure Synapse.
      Publishing Report: Publish the Power BI report to the Power BI Service.
      Monitoring and notifying users:
      Orchestration Tool: Use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate the entire process.
      Monitoring: Monitor the pipeline execution using Azure Data Factory monitoring features.
      Notification: Use Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions to send email notifications about the process execution or errors.
1. With what tools will you do this and what will the connection between them look like?
Ans:- please find tool below This comprehensive setup ensures automated data flow, cleaning, storage, visualization, 
     and monitoring with effective error handling and notification.:-
     Python Script & Email Server: Uses IMAP/POP3 to download CSV files.
     Python Script & Azure Blob Storage: Uses Azure Blob Storage SDK to upload files.
     ADF & Blob Storage: Reads raw files for processing.
     ADF & Synapse: Processes and stores cleaned data.
     Power BI & Synapse: Connects for data visualization.
     ADF & Logic Apps/Functions: Sends notifications on pipeline status.

2. How will the connection between the SQL database and PowerBi online report look like?
Ans:- Create a Report in Power BI Desktop:
Download and install Power BI Desktop if you don't already have it.
Get Data:
Open Power BI Desktop.
Click on Get Data on the Home ribbon.
Select Azure > Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL Data Warehouse) and click Connect.
Connect to Azure Synapse Analytics:

Enter Server and Database Information:
Enter the server name and the database name of your Azure Synapse Analytics.
Click OK.
Authentication:
Choose your authentication method (Windows, Database, or Microsoft Account).
Enter your credentials and click Connect.
Create and Design Your Report:

Load Data:
Select the tables or views you want to import from Synapse Analytics.
Click Load to import the data into Power BI.
Build Visuals:
Use the imported data to create visualizations, charts, and reports in Power BI Desktop.
Publish the Report to Power BI Service:

Save Your Report:
Save your report by clicking File > Save As.
Publish:
Click Publish on the Home ribbon.
Sign in to your Power BI account.
Select the workspace where you want to publish the report and click Select.
Connections Between Tools
Power BI Desktop and Azure Synapse Analytics:

Power BI Desktop connects directly to Azure Synapse Analytics using the Azure Synapse Analytics connector.
This connection allows Power BI to import data from Synapse Analytics for visualization and reporting.
Power BI Service:

Once the report is published, it is hosted in the Power BI Service.
The Power BI Service can refresh the dataset by reconnecting to Azure Synapse Analytics, ensuring the data is up-to-date.
Connection Details
Power BI Desktop to Azure Synapse Analytics:

Connector: Power BI provides a native connector for Azure Synapse Analytics.
Authentication: You can authenticate using Windows Authentication, Database Authentication, or Microsoft Account.
Data Import: Power BI imports data into its in-memory storage for fast performance when creating visuals.
Power BI Service to Azure Synapse Analytics:

Dataset Refresh: Power BI Service can be scheduled to refresh the dataset at regular intervals, 
reconnecting to Azure Synapse Analytics to fetch the latest data.
Gateway: If necessary, configure an On-premises Data Gateway for secure data transfer.
Monitoring and Refreshing
Schedule Refresh:

In the Power BI Service, go to Datasets and select the dataset associated with your report.
Configure Scheduled refresh to define the frequency and time for the dataset to refresh.
Data Alerts and Notifications:

Set up data alerts in Power BI Service for key metrics.
Use Power BIâ€™s alerting feature to notify users via email when data exceeds certain thresholds.
In addition, write how the particular items will be run and what tool you will use to monitor the entire process 
and inform the user via email about the execution or error in the process.


3.write how the particular items will be run and what tool you will use to monitor the entire process and 
    inform the user via email about the execution or error in the process.

Detailed Steps and Monitoring
1. Downloading Files from Email and Saving to Azure

Tools:
Python Script: Scheduled to run periodically (e.g., via Azure Functions or an Azure VM with a cron job).
Azure Blob Storage: For saving the downloaded files.
Execution:

Schedule the Python script to run periodically to check the email and download the files.

Monitoring:
Azure Monitor: To monitor the execution of the script, using logs and alerts.
Azure Application Insights: To track the health and performance of the script.

Notification:
Azure Logic Apps: To send email notifications on success or failure.
