Task: Automate the process of downloading CSV files from an email, cleaning the data, and generating a report in PowerBI.

1. Downloading CSV Files and Saving to Azure Blob Storage

Tools:
-Azure Logic Apps: For automating the download process.
-Azure Blob Storage: For storing the downloaded CSV files.

Steps:
 1.Monitor Email Inbox:
   - Use Azure Logic Apps to monitor the specified email inbox for incoming emails.
   - Configure the Logic App to trigger when an email with the fixed file name is received.

 2. Download and Save Files:
   - Set up the Logic App to download the attached CSV files.
   - Save the downloaded files to a designated folder in **Azure Blob Storage**.

2. Cleaning CSV Files and Saving to SQL Serverless Database

Tools:
- Azure Databricks: For cleaning and processing the data.
- Azure SQL Serverless: For storing the cleaned data.

Steps:
 1. Read and Clean Data:
   - Use Azure Databricks to read the CSV files from Azure Blob Storage.
   - Clean the data by removing rows that are completely empty.

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CSV Cleaning").getOrCreate()
    df = spark.read.csv("path/to/blob/storage/folder", header=True, inferSchema=True)
    cleaned_df = df.dropna(how='all')
    ```

 2. Save Cleaned Data:
   - Write the cleaned data to the **Azure SQL Serverless** database.

    ```python
    cleaned_df.write.format("jdbc").option("url", "jdbc:sqlserver://<server-name>.database.windows.net;database=<database-name>").option("dbtable", "cleaned_data").option("user", "<username>").option("password", "<password>").save()
    ```

 3. Connecting PowerBI to SQL Serverless Database and Publishing Report Online

Tools:
-PowerBI: For creating and publishing reports.

Steps:
 1. Connect to Database:
   - Use PowerBI Desktop to connect to the Azure SQL Serverless database.
   - Import the cleaned data into PowerBI.

 2. Create and Publish Report:
   - Create the report using the data in PowerBI.
   - Publish the report to the PowerBI service
   

4. Monitoring and Email Notifications**

Tools:
- Azure Monitor: For tracking the entire process.
- Azure Logic Apps: For sending email notifications.

Steps:
 1. Setup Monitoring:
   - Use Azure Monitor to track the steps of the process: file download, data cleaning, and report publishing.
   - Configure alerts for any errors or issues during the process.

 2. Email Notifications:
   - Create another Azure Logic App to handle email notifications based on alerts from **Azure Monitor**.
   - Set up the Logic App to send email notifications to the user, providing information on the execution status or any errors.
